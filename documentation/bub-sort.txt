Bubble sort works by comparing the 1st and 2nd numbers in an array 
if the 1st is greater than the 2nd number it will swap and move on to the
next number and the array until there is no number to swap anymore.

1. Initialize size
2. Display "Enter array size"
3. get user input for size
4. initialize arr[size]
5. Display "Enter (size) Elements!!!"
6. for loop until size
    get user input for arr[i]
7. call bubSort(arr, size)
    for loop until size - 1
        initialize bool swapped = false
        for loop until size - i - 1
            if arr[j] greater than arr[j + 1]
                swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1])
                swapped = true
        if is not swapped
            break;
8. Display "Sorted Array: "
9. for loop until size
    Display arr[i]
10. End program
