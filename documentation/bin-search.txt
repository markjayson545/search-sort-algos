binary search works by going to the middle of the index
and predict if the target is less than or greater than
if the target is either less or greater than it will adjust the middle
until it matches the selected target. However, this search algorithm doesn't support
unsorted array, it will trip the calculation and will make the program confused, (wow confused, sumusunod lang si pc eh).
just like a person, we will search the middle of the book first, if it is far or before the letter we will
go back or go on to find the page we are looking for.

1. Intialize int size, target
2. Display "Enter size of Array"
3. Get user Input for size
4. initialize int arr[size]
5. Display "Enter sorted (size) Elements"
6. for loop until size
    Get User Input for arr[i]
7. Display "Enter number you want to find"
8. Get user Input for target
9. initialize int findings()
    binSearch(arr, 0, size - 1, target)
        binSearch(int arr[], int first, int last, int target)
            while first is less than last
                initialize int middle = first + (last - first) / 2
                if arr[middle] is equal to target
                    return middle
                if arr[middle] is less than target
                    first = middle + 1
                else 
                    last = middle - 1
    return 404 
10. if findings == 404
    Display "Element not found in the array"
11. else
    Display "Element found at index (findings)"
12. end program
