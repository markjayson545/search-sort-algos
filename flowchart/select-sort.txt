Selection Sort works by finding the lowest number and swap it to the current higher number, 
if the number first index is lower than the compared number it will ignore it until it 
finds the lowest number than itself.

1. initialize size
2. Display "Enter array size"
3. get user input for size
4. initialize arr[size]
5. Display "Enter (size) Elements!!!"
6. for loop until size
    get user input for arr[i]
7. for loop until size - 1
    initialize int minimum = i;
    for (int j = i + 1; j < size: j++)
        if arr[j] is less than arr[minimum]
            minimum = j;
    swap arr[i] and arr[minimum]
8. Display "Sorted array: "
9. for loop until size
    Display arr[i]
10. End program
